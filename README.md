# Procedural Futuristic City
This is our final project for CPSC 479. We created a procedural futuristic city complete with Worley noise procedural textures and boids flying around.

## Structure
The folder futuristic_city contains the source code 
for a Blender add-on that was our midterm project (with some modifications). 
You can go to futuristic_city/README for more detailed instructions on creating buildings, creating the city, and viewing the boids.

The folder voronoi contains code for the Worley noise procedural texture. You 
can go to voronoi/README for more detailed instructions on how to run the code 
and use the texture in Blender.
