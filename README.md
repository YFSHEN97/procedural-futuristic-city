# Procedural Futuristic City
This is our final project for CPSC 479: Advanced Topics in Computer Graphics, in Fall 2021. It was built by Yifei Shen and Zacharie Sciamma over the course of two months. Our program generates a complete procedural futuristic city, with Worley noise procedural textures and boids flying around to give an aerial tour.

You can see an aerial tour of our city (which was generated in just a few seconds) in this video:

And here is a render of the city using our custom voronoi materials:

The materials are unfortunately too expensive to render a full video, but they do create cool futuristic looks!


## File Structure
The folder futuristic_city contains the source code 
for a Blender add-on that was our midterm project (with some modifications). 
You can go to futuristic_city/README.md for more detailed instructions on creating buildings, creating the city, and viewing the boids. It also contains links to demo videos showing the boid animations we created.

The folder voronoi contains code for the Worley noise procedural texture. You 
can go to voronoi/README.md for more detailed instructions on how to run the code 
and use the texture in Blender.
