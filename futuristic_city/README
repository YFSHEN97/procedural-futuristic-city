Futuristic City Generator

Instructions:
You can install this plugin, activate it in Preferences, and find it in the 
viewport sidebar. If you can't find it, make sure that you are in "Object 
Mode".

Usage:
There are two modes available. You can either generate a single building (you 
may specify all the parameters) or you can create a full city. Our program 
makes a full city by first creating a road network using L-systems and defining
empty plots of land that are subsequently filled with randomly produced 
buildings.

Parameters:
The meaning and effect of all the parameters are explained in the tooltip that 
appears if you hover over them. You are also welcome to generate the model as 
often as you like and see for yourself what it looks like!
