This is our final project. The folder futuristic_city contains the source code 
for a Blender add-on that was our midterm project (with some modifications). 
You can go to futuristic_city/README for more detailed instructions.

The folder voronoi contains code for the Worley noise procedural texture. You 
can go to voronoi/README for more detailed instructions on how to run the code 
and use the texture in Blender.
